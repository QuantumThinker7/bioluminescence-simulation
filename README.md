# Bioluminescence Simulation

This project simulates glowing bioluminescent creatures (like siphonophores) using Python.  
It creates a simple animation showing pulsing light and gentle drifting movement on a dark background, inspired by natural bioluminescence in the ocean.

## Features

- Pulsing glow effect with smooth brightness changes  
- Random drifting movement within a defined area  
- Dark “ocean” background for visual atmosphere  
- Simple and easy to understand code, suitable for learning and experimentation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## How to run

1. If you don’t have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
2. Open your terminal (command prompt) and install required packages by running:

pip install numpy matplotlib

3. Run the simulation script with:

python bioluminescence.py

A window will open showing the animated glowing creatures.

## About this project

This is my first GitHub project, combining my passion for math and biology.  
I created it with some help from AI tools to learn and improve my coding skills.
